## 🔄 Core Functional Workflows

The application operates in a continuous loop through three primary user modules:

### 1. Gatekeeper & Access Control
When the program initializes, users are presented with a preliminary screen to manage terminal access:
* **Create Account:** Registers a new store clerk. The system enforces strict layout policies (names must be $\ge 3$ characters with an uppercase initial; passwords must be $\ge 8$ characters, unique, and begin with a specific uppercase/alphabetic sequence).
* **Login:** Validates active clerk credentials before granting access to the system backend.
* **Forgot Password:** Allows locked-out staff members to securely verify their name and overwrite their password under the same security guidelines.

### 2. The Ordering & Basket Terminal
Once logged in, staff can seamlessly run the restaurant checkout line:
* **Placing Orders:** Clerks pick selections across three interactive localized Chinese-menu directories ( **Main Courses** like *脆辣雞腿包*, **Drinks** like *凍新鮮檸檬茶*, and **Snacks** like *薯條* ). 
* **Order Duplication:** Speed up service by instantly cloning identical orders to a ticket with a single click.
* **The Shopping Basket:** Displays the cumulative grouped transaction ticket, itemized breakdowns, and total amounts. Staff can seamlessly drop a specific order from the list if a customer changes their mind.

### 3. VIP Membership & Checkout Processing
Finalizes transactions while maintaining consumer relationships:
* **Membership Lookup & Creation:** Before taking payment, the terminal checks for a registered membership token. New profiles can be generated instantly, creating a random 6-digit identification number associated with the customer's name.
* **Dynamic Discount Calculation:** Valid members instantly trigger a **20% discount** off the cumulative order amount.
* **Cash Handeling & Receipts:** Processes cash tender inputs, ensures funds are sufficient, handles change distribution math, and generates a structured, live-timestamped receipt.
* **Turnover Records:** Safely saves finalized transactions into a master archive screen displaying calculated net profits and gross receipts.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Staff Registration** | Invalid length or lowercase beginnings. | Blocks creation and prints explicit formatting rule requirements. |
| **Staff Sign-In** | Duplicate entries or wrong passwords. | Restricts access and returns the screen back to safety loops. |
| **Order Management** | Item Removal from Basket. | Shifts the remaining list elements upwards to eliminate empty rows. |
| **Checkout Phase** | Input member number matches database. | Displays user name and automatically slices **20% off the total bill**. |
| **Cash Processing** | Customer cash input is less than calculated total. | **Insufficient fund!** prompt blocks order finalization. |
